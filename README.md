# MovieLab
iOS universal project

This project is written in swift with a blend of Objective-C and uses data from http://api.themoviedb.org/3/

It demonstrates a proficiency in:

Using Service call API,
Core Data,
RestKit,
Storyboards,
Adaptive layout (UISplitViewController),
Auto layout,
Grand Central Dispatch,
UITraitCollection,
UICollectionView,
Reactive Programming - see favorites nav bar item and registerObservableIsFavorite(),
and more...

MovieLab was tested on simulator only and it is not perfect but should illustrate my skills.
