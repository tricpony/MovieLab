# MovieLab
iOS universal project

This project is written in swift with a blend of Objective-C and uses data from http://api.themoviedb.org/3/

It demonstrates a proficiency in:

Using Service call API
Core Data
RestKit
Storyboards
Adaptive layout (UISplitViewController)
Auto layout
UITraitCollection
UICollectionView
Reactive Programming - see favorites nav bar item and registerObservableIsFavorite()
and more...

MovieLab was tested on simulator only and it is not perfect but should illustrate my skills.
